A mobile app that helps you maintain hygiene and health by tracking replacement schedules for daily items like toothbrushes, kitchen sponges, filters, and more. Built for the LAM course at University of Bologna.
## Why Spazzolino?
Existing apps (to-do lists, reminders) are too generic and more focused on productivity. Spazzolino is different:

- Science-based: Replacement schedules based on official studies
- Specialized: Single focus on household item tracking
- Simple: One-click activation
- Educational: Expert-curated descriptions for each item

### Key Features

- Curated catalog of 10 items with scientifically validated expiration dates
- Smart notifications: 7-day advance warning + expiration day reminder
- AI recognition: Scan items with camera using Gemini API
- Statistics: GitHub-style heatmap, top 5 items, category distribution
- Location-based alerts: Get notified when near stores with expiring items (100m radius)
- Customizable frequencies: Adapt schedules to your usage patterns
